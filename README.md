# Flutter Todo App
Listem App is a modern todo app I developed for myself
A simple and intuitive Todo application built with Flutter, utilizing the Riverpod state management library.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks to their todo list.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete, and the completed tasks will be visually distinguished.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from their todo list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored locally on the device, ensuring data persistence even after the app is closed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a seamless user experience on both mobile and tablet devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A popular open-source mobile app development framework created by Google.
- **Riverpod**: A state management library that simplifies the management of application state in Flutter apps.
- **Slidable**: A simple fflutter file that let's you slide through the right or left of your screen

- `lib/`
  - `models/`: Defines the data models for todo items.
